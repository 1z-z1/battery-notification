# battery-notification

This is a script to tell me that my laptop is below 10% battery and needs to be plugged in. 
The option is there to have pre-warning just incase I want to go back and add that.

The notification server I am currently using is Dunst, which works well in my opinion.

Note: Picture is for testing purposes only. 
      Will come back and edit if I get a picture of the battery actually being low.
